{ TODO > Nothing
	I've just finished it and guess what? the program crashed and everything(>70 or 100 lines) got erased, I'm not doing it again, if you want to know what this program does(or was supposed to do):
		-> Generate a 1 to 10 integer array
		-> Shuffle the array(the correct shuffle algorithm, swap index i, i2 with tmp to hold a value)
		-> Sort it randomly(random swap) and checks if it's sorted in every step.
